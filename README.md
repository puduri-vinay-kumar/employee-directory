 🔍 **Reflection**
✅ **Challenges Faced**:
**Responsiveness & Mobile Layouts**:
Adapting the UI for various screen sizes using CSS media queries and Flexbox/Grid required careful layout planning and debugging to ensure a consistent experience across devices.

**Filter & Search Logic Integration**:
Ensuring that filters, search, and sorting logic worked seamlessly together without overwriting each other’s results required thoughtful state management in plain JavaScript.

**DOM Manipulation Without Frameworks**:
Building interactivity like form population, editing, and pagination without libraries like React or Vue posed a challenge but deepened my understanding of vanilla JS.

**Freemarker Simulation Without Backend**:
Since the project didn’t involve a running backend, I had to simulate Freemarker template behavior with static data injection and folder structuring for review purposes.
